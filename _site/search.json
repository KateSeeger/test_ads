I am originally from Eugene, Oregon and love to spend time outdoors playing ultimate frisbee and going on hikes. My academic interests include data visualization, data analytics, and quantitative ecology. This summer, I was a part of the Biological Interactions REU at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I worked in Kate McCulloh’s Ecophysiology Lab and worked with Dr. Christopher Krieg on his doctoral research. I worked on a data set examining the relationship between leaf age and morphological and functional trait optimization. This project focused on MANOVA and PCA. I plan on working in a research assistant/technician position before starting graduate school. You can find me either in Oregon or Minnesota (or some other cool state inbetween).\r\nEducation:\r\n\r\nMacalester College | St. Paul, MN\r\nBA in Biology and Data Science, Sept, 2018 - May, 2022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Overall, was not that informative and I wanted to reach deeper into the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond graph I created was more interesting and I believe showed similar data that was related to the first graph, but instead showing the win ratios between the streaming services. Didn’t like the geom_point().\r\n\r\nTIDY TUESDAY WK 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Graph:\r\nI chose to make this graph because I thought it would be interesting to see the breakdown of the Emmy wins by streaming services. The drastic switch streaming services have made from just being a video streaming platform to a creative/directing platform has changed the industry of streaming and is driving viewership. I chose to show only the comparisons of wins throughout the years via streaming services to show which have grown in popularity and to see if my assumptions held true. I chose these side by side boxplots to better visualize the data and made year a categorical variable. This palette was chosen for its nice and contrasting colors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

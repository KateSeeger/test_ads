## About me: 
I am a biology major and data science minor at Macalester College. I am originally from Eugene, Oregon and love to spend time outdoors playing ultimate frisbee and going on hikes. My academic interests include data visualization, data analytics, and quantitative ecology. This summer, I was a part of the Biological Interactions REU at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I worked in Kate McCulloh's Ecophysiology Lab and worked with Dr. Christopher Krieg on his doctoral research. I worked on a data set examining the relationship between leaf age and morphological and functional trait optimization. This project focused on MANOVA and PCA. I plan on working in a research assistant/technician position before starting graduate school. You can find me either in Oregon or Minnesota (or some other cool state inbetween).
